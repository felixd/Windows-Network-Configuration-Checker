# Windows-Network-Configuration-Checker
Simple Windows batch script to check local computer network health status and send it via Outlook / save to file.

For historical reasons I've left Change log. This script initially created for VERTU to collect information about network configuration from Windows machines when issues appeared and send them to Customer Support team.
